Book Summary: The myelin theory. Deep practice cell. Deliberate practice. Effortless performance is the worst way to learn. 

Myelin Facts: Einstein's brain contained more glia cells that produced myelin. Older people are wiser because they have a strong ssystem of myelinated axon. Young children are able to mylenate early, which is why world class musicians start at a young age and language or music is harder to pick up at a later age. Monkeys have not developed language although we are the same as them, excerpt for the fact that we have more myelin. Myelin can never be removed, only strengthened, which is why habits are hard to break. Must myelinate old circuitry. Breastfed babys have higher IQ bvecause of myelin.

Operation of myelin: Universal. Paramount. Doesn't unwrap, age matters. 

Definition of skill:  Myrlin that is abundant and insulates the electric impulse circuitry at a high level. Grows according to certain signals.

How to practice: Struggle is good. Struggle is myelin. The process of error driven testing is how stronger myelin is formed. Six month of practice in six minutes idea is based off the fact that the girl knew how to deliberate practice. Practice in pieces, slow it down. Isolate each part and analyze it thouroughly. Then connect the pieces for the bigger picture. 

Brazilian Soccer Players:Early game that involves a fast paced sport similar to soccer bvut much more contact. Similar to the system of training helicopter pilots. Idea is to condense the hardest parts to deliberately practice those parts. Doesn't work by mylenating the easy parts. Environment is also a huge factor in how Brazillian soccer players are successful, 

Anders Ericson: Studied how great people did it. Chess grand masters did not have photographic memories, they simply were great at pattern matching. When chess layout is changed, they were less skilled.
