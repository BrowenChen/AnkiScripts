Learn Differently	 Smarts require strategy. Hollistic learning, challenges you to view learning as a comprehensive whole instead of brute force memorization. Integration with new concepts, lateral learning, and active recall. Opposite of rote memorization.

Metaphor of Hollistic Learning	 Web of information, neural networks in the brain. One idea relates to another. Ideas aren’t in isolation. Constructs, Models, Highways, elements of holistic learning. Having interconnected web of ideas means if you don’t know a topic, you can derive the answer rather than relying on recalling it from memory as an isolated idea. 

Constructs	 City in your mind. Buildings in that city. Highly developed constructs are understanding. Easiest building to locate is the one with the most paths. 

Models	 Simplified constructs. Compress core concepts and link together. 

Highways	 Connects the roads that link the concepts together

Sequence of Holistic Learning	 Acquire, Understand, Explore, Debug, Apply. 

Acquire Phase	 Information to brain. Filtering out information, versus aquiring for speed. Speed reading and flow-based note taking. 

Understand Phase	 Link concepts together, build those bridges. 

Explore Phase	 Hollistic Learning. Link to abstract concepts. More roads = more recall in the future. Depth exploration versus lateral exploration. What is this similar to? 

Debug Phase	 Pruning the web and adding exceptions. Opposing views, foundation concepts,.

Apply	 Generate own formulations of tests. Using the informations, creative ways to finish holistic learning. 

Finding Weaknesses	 Concept from talent code. Struggle is the best way to learn. Deliberate practice. Practicing easy things is useless. 

Methods to process information	 Visceralization, metaphor, diagramming, model debugging. 

Make learning engaging	 intrinsic motivation, “ignition”. Justify why your class is boring. Set up better routine.
