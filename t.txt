Simplex Alg	 Start at a vertex. Move to better neighboring vertex until no better. Keep one constraint as is and fix another. Keep tight. Move second. Vertex = intersection of two inequalities. 

Three dimensions	 Three tight constraints define a vertex. Hyperplane. n dimensions -> n variables - n constraints
