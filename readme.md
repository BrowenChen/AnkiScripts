Anki parser


Convert notes from evernote into Anki-readable import files to make learning easier through spaced repitition algorithms. Bolded text will be the front of the flash card while the rest of the text is the back. Cards are seperated by bold text. 

Works by converting every line into tab delimited lines that is readable by Anki. 

Next step would be to be able to feed in an article from Wikipedia and parse that into Anki-readable flashcards.
