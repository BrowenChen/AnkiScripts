Minimal pair	 different phonemes. Evidence. 

Places of articulation 	 Bilabial = lips, labiodental = teeth, Dental = tongue to tip of teeth, Alveolar = Ridge right behind teeth, Retroflex = mid toungue back of the top, Post-alveolar - shy, she, show, palatal = you, velar = 

Manner of Articulation 	 Stops (oral and nasal), nasal, fricative, sibilants, lateral fricatives, affricate, flap, trill, approximant, voiced, continuancy

Labial Consonants	 p,b,m,w,m,f,v

Coronal Consonants	 Tip of the tongue. Theta, t, d, n, s, z, l, fricatives, retroflex.

Dorsal Consonants	 palatal, velar

Glottal	 produced with the epiglottis. No tongue

Approximant	 part of the vocal track is closer to the others, but not enough for turbulence. [w,l, r, j]

Stridency	 hissing sound [s,z,fricatives]

Sonorance	 consonants that have a singable or ringing quality. [w,m,n,l,r,j..]

Vowel Nasalization	 oral vowels — nasal vowels \ nasal stops or vowels. Feature specification for oral vowels = [-cons, + syll, -nas]. nasal vowels = [-cons, +syll, +nas]. We can omit the -cons because of the syllabic. 

Nasal Stop Devoicing	 voiced nasal — voiceless nasal stops / __ voiceless oral stops. Feature matrix would be [+cons, +voice, +nas] — [_cons, -voice, +nas]\ __ [+cons, -son, -syll, -cont, -voice]. Now simplify this.

Phonemes	 Small abstract unitis. Analysis on phonemes to determine allophones. Notion of contrast. 

Phonemes Contrast 	 if subbing out one phoneme for another in the same environment changes the meaning. Sounds to a single phoneme do not contrast. 

Minimal Pairs 	 are pairs of contrasting words. button and bu?n are same phoneme. 

Phonological Distribution 	 depends on the environment in which they occur. Complementary distribution mean not contrastive because contextual variant of another. Overlapping means contrasting, same environment. DOES NOT APPLY TO FREE VARIABLES

Underlying form	 happens as the elsewhere case. Default allophone is elsewhere case. 

Phonological Processes	 Assimilation, when one speech sound squires another (nasal, palatalization)

Dissimilation	 rejects

Epenthesis	 inserts a consonant

Deletion	 consonant is deleted

Lenition	 weakes

Fortition	 more consonant like

Natural Classes	 features that classify certain characteristics
