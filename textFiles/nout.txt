Print file contents	 Read file, print contents do something. Non blocking, when you’re done with something, call back. When the file is done, call back. 

Node Code	 fs.readFile(‘readThis’, function(err, contents){ do something;} )

Hello.js	 var http = require(“http’); create server, status code in header. response body, close the connection. listen for connections on this port. Register known events. Event loops check for events, trigger and then do callback. Javascript has no concept of threads. 

Callbacks	 Event loop. Event handlers that listen for more actions while other actions apply. Work in parallel behind the scenes. Nonblocking techniques. readFileSync means no callbacks

fs module	 require is javascript way of saying require a module. fs.readFile reads the file, writeFile writes to a file. readFileSync means no callbacks

#!/usr…	 This means you can execute directly. you use chmod +x to make a file executable. ./cat.js <file_name> is how you run it.
