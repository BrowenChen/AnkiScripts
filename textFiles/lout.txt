Minimal pair	 different phonemes. Evidence. 

Places of articulation 	 Bilabial = lips, labiodental = teeth, Dental = tongue to tip of teeth, Alveolar = Ridge right behind teeth, Retroflex = mid toungue back of the top, Post-alveolar - shy, she, show, palatal = you, velar = 

Manner of Articulation 	 Stops (oral and nasal), nasal, fricative, sibilants, lateral fricatives, affricate, flap, trill, approximant, voiced, continuancy

Labial Consonants	 p,b,m,w,m,f,v

Coronal Consonants	 Tip of the tongue. Theta, t, d, n, s, z, l, fricatives, retroflex.

Dorsal Consonants	 palatal, velar

Glottal	 produced with the epiglottis. No tongue

Approximant	 part of the vocal track is closer to the others, but not enough for turbulence. [w,l, r, j]

Stridency	 hissing sound [s,z,fricatives]

Sonorance	 consonants that have a singable or ringing quality. [w,m,n,l,r,j..]

Vowel Nasalization	 oral vowels — nasal vowels \ nasal stops or vowels. Feature specification for oral vowels = [-cons, + syll, -nas]. nasal vowels = [-cons, +syll, +nas]. We can omit the -cons because of the syllabic. 

Nasal Stop Devoicing	 voiced nasal — voiceless nasal stops / __ voiceless oral stops. Feature matrix would be [+cons, +voice, +nas] — [_cons, -voice, +nas]\ __ [+cons, -son, -syll, -cont, -voice]. Now simplify this.

Phonemes	 Small abstract unitis. Analysis on phonemes to determine allophones. Notion of contrast. 

Phonemes Contrast 	 if subbing out one phoneme for another in the same environment changes the meaning. Sounds to a single phoneme do not contrast. 

Minimal Pairs 	 are pairs of contrasting words. button and bu?n are same phoneme. 

Phonological Distribution 	 depends on the environment in which they occur. Complementary distribution mean not contrastive because contextual variant of another. Overlapping means contrasting, same environment. DOES NOT APPLY TO FREE VARIABLES

Underlying form	 happens as the elsewhere case. Default allophone is elsewhere case. 

Phonological Processes	 Assimilation, when one speech sound squires another (nasal, palatalization)

Dissimilation	 rejects

Epenthesis	 inserts a consonant

Deletion	 consonant is deleted

Lenition	 weakes

Fortition	 more consonant like

Natural Classes	 features that classify certain characteristics 

Syllabic	 vowels. 

Overlapping Distribution	 speech sounds are contrastive because they appear in the same environment but the allophones change the meanings of the words.

Complementary Distribution	 speech sounds are not contrastive. Same Phoneme 

Feature Rule for [s] — [esh] \ __ i	 [-syll, +cor, +ant, +cont] — [-ant] \ __[+syll, +high, -back]

Feeding Order 	 rule A creates environment that rule B can apply to

Bleeding Order	 rule A removes an environment that rule B would apply to

Palatalization 	 The little subscript j. Produced with the tongue in the mouth near the hard palate. 

Identifying Natural Classes	 Major class features, place and manner, combination of that. These include consonantal, obstruents, sonorant consonants, continuants, anterior consonants. 

Rule Ordering	 underlying representation, final fronting, palatalization, surface representation.

Morphemes, bound vs free	 smallest unit of meaning. Bound cannot appear alone while free morphemes can appear by itself. Affixation, compounding, etc. Study of the structure of words. 

Perfective and Imperfective	 Imperfective is ongoing and habitual. Perfective is past. 

Allomorphy	 allomorphs are morphnes that exhibit environmentally conditioned realizations. If a morpheme surfaces in more than one way, thats allomorphs. 

Types of environments	 Phonological environments. Solely by sound. Morphological environemtsn is determined by the type of usage. Lexical environments are those that have no structured methodology. Morphological includes 1st, 2st, 3femsg, etc.
